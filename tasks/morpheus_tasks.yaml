# 🎓 Educational Tasks (Delegated to Specialists)
# ───────────────────────────────────────────────

review_ai_policy_task:
  description: >
    You are Morpheus, analyzing a syllabus to determine whether it includes a clear AI policy.

    If an AI policy is present:
    - Identify and cite the relevant text.
    - Assess its tone, clarity, and enforcement expectations.
    - Classify it as either a Prohibition, Permissive, or Encouraged model based on alignment with the definitions below.

    If no policy is found:
    - Clearly acknowledge the absence of an AI policy in the syllabus.
    - Then present the **full, verbatim language** of all three official Miramar College policy models (below), as a reference for the instructor:

      1. **Prohibition of AI Tools**  
         In this course, students are not permitted to use AI tools for assignments, exams, or other coursework submissions.  
         The objective is to promote direct engagement with the material and ensure the development of students' critical thinking,  
         problem-solving, and writing skills. Violations, including plagiarism or submission of AI-generated content as original work,  
         will be treated as academic misconduct according to the college's academic integrity policies.

      2. **Permissive Use of AI Tools**  
         In this course, students are allowed to use AI tools to assist with certain aspects of their coursework, such as research,  
         drafting, and problem-solving. However, students must exercise critical judgment when evaluating AI-generated content for accuracy and relevance.  
         All submissions must include a statement explaining the extent of AI assistance. Adherence to academic integrity policies is expected,  
         and AI-generated content must not be presented as original work without proper citation.

      3. **Encouraged Use of AI Tools**  
         In this course, students are encouraged to explore the use of AI tools to enhance their learning experience. These tools can be used for brainstorming,  
         research, and deepening understanding of complex concepts. Students must document the role AI played in their work and follow academic integrity guidelines,  
         including proper attribution of AI-generated content. This approach aims to foster critical engagement with technology and innovation.

    After reviewing the syllabus, provide:
    - A summary of the three models' key use cases
    - A recommendation for which model best fits the course context
    - Practical suggestions for implementation and revision

    You may consult with the Academic Affairs Specialist or AI Digital Coach for specialized insights on policy implementation or AI tool recommendations.

  expected_output: >
    Return your response in three clearly labeled sections:

    ## Policy Status  
    - State whether the syllabus includes an AI policy.  
    - If yes, quote it directly and classify it (Prohibition, Permissive, or Encouraged).  
    - If not, note its absence and include the three official Miramar models (quoted exactly from the description).

    ## Recommendations  
    - Recommend which model (or hybrid) best fits the course under review.  
    - Provide reasoning based on course content, discipline, and goals.  
    - Summarize how each model could serve different instructional needs.

    ## Implementation Notes and Suggestions  
    - Offer 2–4 clear suggestions for revising or adding an AI policy.  
    - Use language and examples that are practical for instructors.  
    - If no policy is found, suggest where and how to insert one using the Miramar models as templates.

    Use line breaks between sections and paragraphs to improve readability. Avoid overly rigid formatting or numbered lists unless helpful.

ai_review_assignment_task:
  description: >
    You are Morpheus, analyzing an uploaded assignment prompt for how students might shortcut or complete the task using AI tools.

    - The Curriculum Developer (for redesign strategies and pedagogical frameworks)
    - The AI Digital Coach (for AI literacy and policy framing)
    - The Academic Affairs Specialist (for inclusive and student-centered redesign)

  expected_output: >
    Return your response in three clearly labeled sections:

ai_meter_assignment_task:
  description: >
    You are Morpheus, reviewing an uploaded assignment prompt to help the instructor decide **how much AI use to allow**, and **where it should be restricted**, based on sound pedagogy and responsible innovation.

    Prioritize analysis of the actual assignment prompt. Offer guidance for how AI tools:
    - Might help in specific phases of the assignment (brainstorming, drafting, revising)
    - Should be *avoided* in certain stages to preserve learning outcomes
    - Can support skill development, digital literacy, and student agency

    Support your guidance with 1–2 citations drawn from relevant educational frameworks (e.g., self-regulated learning, digital agency, moral imagination, transparency in tech, etc.). Vary sources when possible.

    This is a reflective support task led by you, Morpheus. You may consult:
    - The AI Digital Coach (for AI literacy and policy alignment)
    - The Curriculum Developer (for pedagogical alignment)
    - The Academic Affairs Specialist (for ethical boundaries and learner growth)

    Keep the tone supportive, insightful, and grounded in sound learning design.

  expected_output: >
    Return your response in three clearly labeled sections:

    ## AI Use Suggestions  
    - Offer assignment-specific suggestions for how AI could support learning  
    - Indicate when in the assignment process each applies  
    - Emphasize reflection, student control, and transparency

    ## Cautions and Boundaries  
    - Identify where AI *should not* be used in the assignment  
    - Explain why, using educational rationale

    ## Frameworks and Citations  
    - Reference 1–2 educational frameworks or scholarly sources  
    - Vary sources when possible (avoid repeating Zimmerman every time)  
    - Include full citation details in APA or MLA style
