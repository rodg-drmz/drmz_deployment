review_ai_policy_task:
  description: >
    Analyze the syllabus to determine whether it includes a clear AI policy.

    If an AI policy is present:
    - Identify and cite the relevant text.
    - Assess its tone, clarity, and enforcement expectations.
    - Classify it as either a Prohibition, Permissive, or Encouraged model based on alignment with the definitions below.

    If no policy is found:
    - Clearly acknowledge the absence of an AI policy in the syllabus.
    - Then present the **full, verbatim language** of all three official Miramar College policy models (below), as a reference for the instructor:

      1. **Prohibition of AI Tools**  
         In this course, students are not permitted to use AI tools for assignments, exams, or other coursework submissions.  
         The objective is to promote direct engagement with the material and ensure the development of students’ critical thinking,  
         problem-solving, and writing skills. Violations, including plagiarism or submission of AI-generated content as original work,  
         will be treated as academic misconduct according to the college's academic integrity policies.

      2. **Permissive Use of AI Tools**  
         In this course, students are allowed to use AI tools to assist with certain aspects of their coursework, such as research,  
         drafting, and problem-solving. However, students must exercise critical judgment when evaluating AI-generated content for accuracy and relevance.  
         All submissions must include a statement explaining the extent of AI assistance. Adherence to academic integrity policies is expected,  
         and AI-generated content must not be presented as original work without proper citation.

      3. **Encouraged Use of AI Tools**  
         In this course, students are encouraged to explore the use of AI tools to enhance their learning experience. These tools can be used for brainstorming,  
         research, and deepening understanding of complex concepts. Students must document the role AI played in their work and follow academic integrity guidelines,  
         including proper attribution of AI-generated content. This approach aims to foster critical engagement with technology and innovation.

    After reviewing the syllabus, provide:
    - A summary of the three models' key use cases
    - A recommendation for which model best fits the course context
    - Practical suggestions for implementation and revision

  expected_output: >
    Return your response in three clearly labeled sections:

    ## Policy Status  
    - State whether the syllabus includes an AI policy.  
    - If yes, quote it directly and classify it (Prohibition, Permissive, or Encouraged).  
    - If not, note its absence and include the three official Miramar models (quoted exactly from the description).

    ## Recommendations  
    - Recommend which model (or hybrid) best fits the course under review.  
    - Provide reasoning based on course content, discipline, and goals.  
    - Summarize how each model could serve different instructional needs.

    ## Implementation Notes and Suggestions  
    - Offer 2–4 clear suggestions for revising or adding an AI policy.  
    - Use language and examples that are practical for instructors.  
    - If no policy is found, suggest where and how to insert one using the Miramar models as templates.

    Use line breaks between sections and paragraphs to improve readability. Avoid overly rigid formatting or numbered lists unless helpful.

ai_review_assignment_task:
  description: >
    Analyze the uploaded assignment prompt for how students might shortcut or complete the task using AI tools.

    Then offer:
    - Redesign strategies to make the task more original, deeper, or more resistant to automation
    - Suggestions for clearly defining appropriate AI use
    - Recommendations for adapting the task to inclusive, student-centered pedagogies (e.g. CRT, PBL, gamification, etc.)

    This is a collaborative task led by Morpheus. If needed, Morpheus may consult:
    - The Curriculum Developer (for redesign strategies)
    - The AI Integrationist (for AI literacy and policy framing)
    - The Faculty Coach (for inclusive and student-centered redesign)

  expected_output: >
    Return your response in three clearly labeled sections:

    ## AI Use Risks  
    - Identify how AI tools might be used to shortcut or complete the assignment  
    - Note what skills or thinking may be bypassed  
    - Optionally include example outputs or techniques (e.g. ChatGPT prompt examples)

    ## Redesign Recommendations  
    - Offer revised versions or variations of the task  
    - Emphasize strategies that promote deeper engagement, creativity, or critical thinking  
    - Note how AI use could be structured (or restricted) for better learning

    ## Implementation Suggestions  
    - Offer 2–4 practical notes for instructors (e.g. framing, rubric updates, scaffolding)
    - Include optional references to frameworks like CRT, PBL, SEL, or flipped learning

ai_meter_assignment_task:
  description: >
    Review the uploaded assignment prompt and help the instructor decide **how much AI use to allow**, and **where it should be restricted**, based on sound pedagogy and responsible innovation.

    Prioritize analysis of the actual assignment prompt. Offer guidance for how AI tools:
    - Might help in specific phases of the assignment (brainstorming, drafting, revising)
    - Should be *avoided* in certain stages to preserve learning outcomes
    - Can support skill development, digital literacy, and student agency

    Support your guidance with 1–2 citations drawn from relevant educational frameworks (e.g., self-regulated learning, digital agency, moral imagination, transparency in tech, etc.). Vary sources when possible.

    This is a reflective support task led by Morpheus. He may consult:
    - The AI Integrationist (for AI literacy and policy alignment)
    - The Curriculum Developer (for pedagogical alignment)
    - The Faculty Coach (for ethical boundaries and learner growth)

    Keep the tone supportive, insightful, and grounded in sound learning design.

  expected_output: >
    Return your response in three clearly labeled sections:

    ## AI Use Suggestions  
    - Offer assignment-specific suggestions for how AI could support learning  
    - Indicate when in the assignment process each applies  
    - Emphasize reflection, student control, and transparency

    ## Cautions and Boundaries  
    - Identify where AI *should not* be used in the assignment  
    - Explain why, using educational rationale

    ## Frameworks and Citations  
    - Reference 1–2 educational frameworks or scholarly sources  
    - Vary sources when possible (avoid repeating Zimmerman every time)  
    - Include full citation details in APA or MLA style

ai_redesign_assignment_task:
  description: >
    Reimagine the assignment using inclusive, student-centered, or active learning strategies.

    Your response should:
    - Offer a revised version of the task that incorporates CRT, PBL, SEL, gamification, or flipped learning
    - Justify the changes with reference to scaffolding, cultural relevance, student voice, or creative engagement
    - Suggest framing language, reflection prompts, or peer roles that enhance student agency and originality
    - Cite pedagogical theorists and frameworks like Freire, Ladson-Billings, CASEL, or Dewey

    This is a creative design task led by Morpheus. He may consult:
    - The Curriculum Developer (for learning objectives and redesigns)
    - The Faculty Coach (for inclusive practices)
    - The Student Ally (for feedback on engagement and accessibility)

  expected_output: >
    Return your response in three clearly labeled sections:

    ## Redesigned Task  
    - Present a reimagined version of the assignment  
    - Incorporate frameworks like CRT, PBL, SEL, gamification, or flipped classroom  
    - Make the task more engaging, inclusive, and student-centered

    ## Justification and Strategy
